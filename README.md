# solana-token-sniper-bot
A Next.js-based Solana trading bot that targets newly created tokens on sniper.xyz
Monitor trading activity and performance
How It Works
Token Detection
The bot monitors the Solana blockchain for new token creations using:

Helius webhooks to receive notifications of TOKEN_MINT transactions
Direct monitoring of the Solana blockchain for token initialization instructions
When a new token is detected, the bot validates it against configurable criteria before proceeding to trading.

Trading Execution
Once a valid token is detected, the bot:

Opens a headless browser session to sniper.xyz
Navigates to the token's page using its mint address
Executes a buy transaction with the configured amount
Monitors the position and applies take profit/stop loss rules as configured
Security Considerations
The bot requires wallet permissions to execute trades
Use a dedicated trading wallet with limited funds for security
All sensitive operations are performed client-side in the user's browser
No private keys are stored or transmitted
Disclaimer
Trading cryptocurrency involves significant risk. This bot is provided for educational purposes only. Use at your own risk with funds you can afford to lose. Always test extensively on testnet before deploying to mainnet.
